               <p class="lb-text">Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. Most of its body is colored orange, 
                while its underbelly is light yellow and it has blue eyes. It has a flame at the end of its tail, which is said to signify its health.
                Charmander's design is based on a lizard, however as its name suggests it may also have been inspired by salamanders, 
                which in mythology have an affinity with fire.</p>
